===E4X Resetting Titan Levels
This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod. It causes all faction's titans to lose their levels when they are destroyed. This is accomplished by instantly destroying the titan when it is built, then spawning in a new, level 1 titan.

Do not be alarmed when your titan is destroyed right when it is built, it will warp in at level one a second later!
