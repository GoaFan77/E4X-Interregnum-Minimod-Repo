This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod. It causes all faction's titans to lose their levels when they are destroyed. This is accomplished by instantly destroying the titan when it is built, then spawning in a new, level 1 titan.

Do not be alarmed when your titan is destroyed right when it is built, it will warp in at level one a second later!

To install the minimod, place this folder into your mod folder. In the mods tab of the main menu, enable this mod ABOVE the main Enhanced 4X Mod.

In addition, if you are using the Deathmatch Minimod, make sure this minimod is below it in your mod order.
