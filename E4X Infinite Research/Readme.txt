===E4X Infinite Research===
This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod (http://forums.sinsofasolarempire.com/414639). It adds two late game techs, Surviveability Mastery and Weapon Mastery, which will slightly boost the performance of your units, but can be researched 999 times.

These techs get more expensive each time they're researched, but allow late game Empires with lots of resources that can't be used for anything else to gain an advantage.

This minimod may be used with Interregnum. 

For further information, see the readme in the main Enhanced 4X mod or visit the thread in the URL above.
