A minimod made for the Enhanced 4X Mod (http://forums.sinsofasolarempire.com/414639), but will work with any mod. It changes the main menu music to the Original Sins theme.

To Install, place this mod ABOVE the main Enhanced 4X Mod in your mod order.

To return to the Rebellion Main Menu theme, disable this mod and delete the Rebellion Title.ogg file from the main Enhanced 4X Mod's sound folder.
