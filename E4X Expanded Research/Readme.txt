===E4X Expanded Research===
This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod. It doubles the amount of stat improving research available, I.e. from 2 levels to 4. This allows players who invest in research to be much more powerful and keeps research as part of the game for longer.

Note that no research requirements have been changed, so it is no difficult to research any one particular tech than it was before, there is just more of them if you choose to research them.

This minimod may be used with Interregnum.
