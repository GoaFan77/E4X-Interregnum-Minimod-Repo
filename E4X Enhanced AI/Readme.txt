This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod. It seeks to make the AI more challenging by giving it certain non-economic and non-military bonuses in areas it is weak in like research.

None of these bonuses directly improves the AI's stats, so it is meant to add more difficult to your favorite AI level without it feeling like it is "cheating".

To install the minimod, place this folder into your mod folder. In the mods tab of the main menu, enable this mod
ABOVE the main Enhanced 4X Mod.
