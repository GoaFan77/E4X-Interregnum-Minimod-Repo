===E4X Enhanced AI===
This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod. It seeks to make the AI more challenging by giving it certain non-economic and non-military bonuses in areas it is weak in like research.

None of these bonuses directly improves the AI's stats, so it is meant to add more difficult to your favorite AI level without it feeling like it is "cheating".

This minimod may be used with Interregnum.
