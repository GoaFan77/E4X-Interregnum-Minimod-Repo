===E4X Exploding Mines===
This is a minimod for the Enhanced 4X Mod (http://forums.sinsofasolarempire.com/414639). By default, mines in Enhanced 4X do not explode, rather they deal damage over time to enemy ships. This minimod changes them so they explode again.

Warning: The mine limit counts are still drastically lower in this minimod, thus the mines are still more expensive and have much longer range than standard Sins mines. They also do much more damage, so use extreme caution!

For further information, see the readme in the main Enhanced 4X mod or visit the thread in the URL above.
