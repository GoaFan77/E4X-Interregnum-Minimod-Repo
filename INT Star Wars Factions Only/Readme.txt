This is a minimod for Star Wars: Interregnum. DO NOT USE THIS MINIMOD with E4X.

This minimod disables all vanilla Sins/E4X factions, allowing you to similate battles from the Galactic Civil War.

This minimod does not change how the map generates, so random encounters featuring Vanilla units may still appear.
